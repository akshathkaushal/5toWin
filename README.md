# 5toWin
I designed this project for my Networks course(fall 2019-2020). It is a 3 client 1 server program in which the server organises a Q/A game for the three players. 
The game starts when all the 3 players are connected to the server. The server then briefs the layers about the rules and starts the game. If a player presses the buzzer, he is given the chance to answer the question. If the answer is correct, a point is given to him.
The first player to answer 5 questions wins.
